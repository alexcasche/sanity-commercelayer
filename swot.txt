COMMERCE LAYER SWOT

PLATFORM:

STRENGTHS
  - Very quick and painless to get up and running 
  - Sanity & Commerce Layer code lives in same repo
  - Single command gets storefront/cms running locally

WEAKNESSES
  - Running things locally does not work (auth error)
  - Starter not complete (PDPs don't exist), can't checkout etc
  - Codebase is very opinionated and confusing
  - Not actual best of breed approach

OPPORTUNITIES
  - Improve on their next starter
  - More clearly separate commerce code from storefront code

THREATS
  - Vendor lock-in (other than CMS) means it's really an all or nothing solution
  - No app ecosystem exists for returns/etc


DOCS/SUPPORT:

STRENGTHS
  - Well organized, clean, and concise
  - Internal objects & their attributes spelled out in detail (ex: Addresses)
  - Chat support offered in dashboard - received response in < 10 min

WEAKNESSES
  - eCommerce topics are complex and far less approachable than in Shopify
  - No examples of how to integrate CMS's or 3 parties
  - Examples are only shown as CURL commands
  - No examples of how to actually plug into a storefront codebase/framework

OPPORTUNITIES
  - Include more full getting started examples integrating a CMS
  - Show patterns for integrating into Storefont
  - Provide examples of actual projects/snippets for Nuxt/Next
  - Encourage creation of themes since eCommerce platform does not change

THREATS
  - Ease of use/understanding is major barrier
  - Could lose clients to platforms that are more approachable


NACELLE SWOT

PLATFORM:

STRENGTHS
  - Better suited to glue pieces of headless backend together
  - Truly best of breed / platform agnostic
  - Direct integrations with 3rd party CMS'
  - Better performance (fewer required API calls per page)

WEAKNESSES
  - Unclear of what Nacelle owns vs what merchants own (frontend, etc)
  - Starters encourage merchants to view Nuxt/Next as core piece of the product
  - Setup more involved and time consuming (esp for clients new to commerce)
  - More difficult for agencies to create reusable themes that support multiple eCommerce platforms 

OPPORTUNITIES
  - Create more separation between starters and Nacelle platform
  - Easier adoption since it plugs into existing systems that may be at play (Shopify)
  - Since it's truly best of breed easier to create beneficial partnerships
  - Make the onboarding process more automated

THREATS
  - Internationalization of commerce layer feels more complete


DOCS/SUPPORT:

STRENGTHS
  - Includes more applicable code snippets
  - Includes examples of integrating 3rd parties
  - References frameworks and provides solutions based on those
  - Responsive/dedicated support via Slack

WEAKNESSES
  - Not that easy to navigate, some areas feel like duplication
  - Drifts between agnostic examples, and framework specific examples
  - Missing component explanations for starters
  - No simple support integration in dashboard
  - Dashboard feels less complete

OPPORTUNITIES
  - Making docs only about backend, and frontend data fetching
  - Documenting all starter specific code in repo Readme for better separation
  - Better present best of breed approach in docs
  - Streamline getting started so the steps are far simpler
  - Possible for commerce layer & Nacelle to work in tandem???

THREATS
  - Limitations from eCommerce platforms could drive clients to commerce layer
  - Internationalization not entirely clear in dashboard
  - Confusing why link lists are in dashboard & not CMS
